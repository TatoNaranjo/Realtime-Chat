## What is Realtime Chat?
Realtime chat is a project made with **React**, having as database **Firestore**, Google's non-relational database, and using **Firebase** as an authenticator method for user registration. It owes its name to the way in which the data is updated in real time thanks to Firebase. This was a project made by TatoNaranjo to learn by creating tools with applications that you could find in real life.

## Demo
